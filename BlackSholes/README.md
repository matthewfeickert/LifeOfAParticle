# Description
This is meant to be used to learn how Monte Carlo random numbers can be used to model financial mathematics systems, specifically the price of an asset S(t) as is used in the Black-Sholes model [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes_equation#Derivation](Link to URL).  There are three examples and one that we built together in class.  The one we built together in class has no comments, whereas the three examples do.

# stock_v0.py
This is the first level where we try to model a single time sequence evolution of the price of an asset.

# stock_v1.py
In this, we study the final endpoint distribution of the price of an asset.

# stock_v2.py
In this, we study how the features of the final endpoint distribution change as the amount of time you hold
the asset themselves change.

# GenSinglePath.py
This is the model we built together in class, but is equivalent to `stock_v1.py` except for the parameter values and plot styles.
